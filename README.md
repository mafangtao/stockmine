## ðŸ¤” Why make '_Tweet2Stocks_'?

This project was created for the [HackUIowa](https://hackuiowa-2019.devpost.com/) event. 

HackUIowa is a 2 day non-stop hackathon, and it will be held at University of Iowa in the heart of downtown Iowa City, USA. The event is open to all university students that have a passion for creating things with technology!

## Technologies

The code is written in Python and its entity detection and sentiment analysis is
done using Google's [Cloud Natural Language API](https://cloud.google.com/natural-language/) and the
[Wikidata Query Service](https://query.wikidata.org/) provides the company data.

Follow these steps to run the code yourself:

### 2. Set up auth

The authentication keys for the different APIs are read from shell environment
variables. Each service has different steps to obtain them.

#### Twitter

Log in to your [Twitter](https://twitter.com/) account and
[create a new application](https://apps.twitter.com/app/new). Under the *Keys
and Access Tokens* tab for [your app](https://apps.twitter.com/) you'll find
the *Consumer Key* and *Consumer Secret*. Export both to environment variables:

```shell
export TWITTER_CONSUMER_KEY="<YOUR_CONSUMER_KEY>"
export TWITTER_CONSUMER_SECRET="<YOUR_CONSUMER_SECRET>"
```

If you want the tweets to come from the same account that owns the application,
simply use the *Access Token* and *Access Token Secret* on the same page. If
you want to tweet from a different account, follow the
[steps to obtain an access token](https://dev.twitter.com/oauth/overview). Then
export both to environment variables:

```shell
export TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN="<YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN>"
export TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET="<YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET>"
```

### 2. Install dependencies

There are a few library dependencies, which you can install using
[pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/quickstart/):

```shell
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Run the program

```shell script
python3 tweet2stocks.py
```
