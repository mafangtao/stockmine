## ðŸ¤” Why make '_Stock Flight_'?

This project was created for the 2019 [HackUIowa](https://hackuiowa-2019.devpost.com/) event. 

HackUIowa was a 2 day non-stop hackathon, and it was held at University of Iowa in the heart of downtown Iowa City, USA.

## Technologies

The code is written in Python and its entity detection and sentiment analysis is
done using Google's [Cloud Natural Language API](https://cloud.google.com/natural-language/) and the
[Wikidata Query Service](https://query.wikidata.org/) provides the company data.

Follow these steps to run the code yourself:

### 1. Set up auth

The authentication keys for the different APIs are read from shell environment
variables. Each service has different steps to obtain them.

#### Twitter

Log in to your [Twitter](https://twitter.com/) account and
[create a new application](https://apps.twitter.com/app/new). Under the *Keys
and Access Tokens* tab for [your app](https://apps.twitter.com/) you'll find
the *Consumer Key* and *Consumer Secret*. Export both to environment variables:

```shell
export TWITTER_CONSUMER_KEY="<YOUR_CONSUMER_KEY>"
export TWITTER_CONSUMER_SECRET="<YOUR_CONSUMER_SECRET>"
```

If you want the tweets to come from the same account that owns the application,
simply use the *Access Token* and *Access Token Secret* on the same page. If
you want to tweet from a different account, follow the
[steps to obtain an access token](https://dev.twitter.com/oauth/overview). Then
export both to environment variables:


```shell
export TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN="<YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN>"
export TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET="<YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET>"
```

#### Google

Follow the
[Google Application Default Credentials instructions](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/application-default-credentials#howtheywork)
to create, download, and export a service account key.

```shell
export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="/path/to/credentials-file.json"
```

You also need to [enable the Cloud Natural Language API](https://cloud.google.com/natural-language/docs/getting-started#set_up_your_project)
for your Google Cloud Platform project.

### 2. Install dependencies

There are a few library dependencies, which you can install using
[pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/quickstart/):

```shell
$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Set up `.env`

`.env` is the file used to store API keys.

```shell
TWITTER_CONSUMER_KEY=
TWITTER_CONSUMER_SECRET=
TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN=
TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET=
GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=
```

### 4. Run the program using the following examples

Run `stockflight` to start mining and analyzing tweets using keywords.

```shell
$ python3 stockflight.py --keywords TSLA,'Elon Musk',Musk,Tesla,SpaceX
```

Run `stockflight` to start mining and analyzing tweets using keywords along with a set of ignored keywords.

```shell
$ python3 stockflight.py \
    --keywords TSLA,'Elon Musk',Musk,Tesla,SpaceX \
    --ignored-keywords win,Win,giveaway,Giveaway
```

Run `stockflight` to start mining and analyzing tweets from specific users specified in a file.

```shell
$ python3 stockflight.py --file users.txt
```

Run `stockflight` to start mining and analyzing tweets from specific users specified in a file along with a set of required keywords that each tweet from those user's feeds must contain.

```shell
$ python3 stockflight.py \
    --file users.txt \
    --required-keywords Tesla,@Tesla,#Tesla,tesla,TSLA,tsla,#TSLA,#tsla,'elonmusk',Elon,Musk
```

Run `stockflight` to start mining and analyzing tweets from specific users specified in a file along with a set of required keywords that each tweet from those user's feeds must contain, plus ignored keywords.

```shell
$ python3 stockflight.py \
    --file users.txt \
    --required-keywords Tesla,@Tesla,#Tesla,tesla,TSLA,tsla,#TSLA,#tsla,'elonmusk',Elon,Musk \
    --ignored-keywords win,Win,giveaway,Giveaway
```

Run `stockflight` to start mining and analyzing Yahoo Finance news headlines and following headline links and scraping relevant text on landing page.

```sh
$ python3 stockflight.py --news-headlines --follow-links --symbol TSLA
```

Run `stockflight` to fetch stock data pertaining to a given company.

```sh
$ python3 stockflight.py --symbol TSLA
```
